## My process used for creation

###  The page was  Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsivity
- [Styled Components](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bai+Jamjuree) - For font styles
- [Icons images](https://fontawesome.com)- For icon images
- [Color properties](https://convertingcolors.com/hsl-color-171_50_44.html)-For color


### What I learned

In this Project I have been able to learn how to built a website that is responsive i.e it can be viewed on a mobile phone or desktop without antyhing overlapping each other.

To see how you can add code responsivity, see below:

```html
<h1>A history of everything you copy</h1>
```
```css
@media only screen and (min-width:800px){
    .title{
        font-size: 50px;
        font-weight: 500px;

    }
```

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to understand some css properties ie how and when to use them. I really liked this page as it has almost all the resources needed to learn about Web Development
- [Kevin Powell Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn-DQCifeQQm) - This is an amazing youtube channel which helped me finally understand what responsivity entails. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept to go over to his yourube channel.
